The Maven lifecycle is an essential concept to understand how Maven manages the build process. You can refer to the official Maven documentation on the introduction to the lifecycle for more in-depth information. Here's how to integrate that into the previous steps:

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window on your system.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the root directory of your Maven project. For example:
     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\project
     ```

3. **Run Validation:**
   - To validate the project (check for basic errors), use the following command:
     ```bash
     mvn validate
     ```

4. **Run Compilation:**
   - To compile the project, use the following command:
     ```bash
     mvn compile
     ```

   This command compiles the source code of the project.

5. **(Optional) Run Tests:**
   - If your project includes tests, you can run them using the following command:
     ```bash
     mvn test
     ```

   This command will compile and run the tests for your project.

6. **Reference Maven Lifecycle:**
   - Understand the Maven Lifecycle by referring to the official documentation: [Introduction to the Build Lifecycle](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html).

7. **Review Output:**
   - Maven will provide output in the console, indicating the progress of the validation, compilation, and test phases. Look for any error messages or warnings.

These commands, along with the reference to the Maven Lifecycle documentation, should help you validate, compile, and test your Maven project from the command line. If you want to delve deeper into the Maven build lifecycle, the provided reference is an excellent resource.
