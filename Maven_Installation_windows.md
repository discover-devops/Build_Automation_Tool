Installing Apache Maven on Windows involves a few straightforward steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Prerequisites:**
- Make sure you have Java installed on your system. Maven requires Java to run. You can download and install Java from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

**Steps:**

1. **Download Maven:**
   - Visit the official Apache Maven website: [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
   - Under "Files," look for the latest stable release and download the ZIP file. For example, you might download a file named `apache-maven-3.8.4-bin.zip`.

2. **Extract Maven:**
   - Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a location on your computer. For example, you can extract it to `C:\Program Files\`.

3. **Set up Environment Variables:**
   - You need to set up the `M2_HOME` and `MAVEN_HOME` environment variables to point to the Maven installation directory. Additionally, add the Maven `bin` directory to the `PATH` variable.
   
     - Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" on your desktop or in File Explorer and select "Properties."
     - Click on "Advanced system settings" on the left.
     - Click the "Environment Variables..." button.
     - Under "System variables," click "New" to add a new variable.
       - Variable name: `M2_HOME`
       - Variable value: The path to your Maven installation directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.8.4`).
     - Find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section, select it, and click "Edit."
     - Click "New" and add the path to the `bin` directory within your Maven installation (e.g., `C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.8.4\bin`).
     - Click "OK" to close the dialogs.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt (CMD) window.
   - Type `mvn -version` and press Enter. This should display information about your Maven installation, including the version number.

If everything is set up correctly, you have successfully installed Apache Maven on your Windows system. You can now use Maven for building and managing Java projects.
